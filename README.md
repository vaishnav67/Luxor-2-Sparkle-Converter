# Luxor 2 Sparkle Converter
Ever wanted to convert your Luxor's path.obj into Sparkle's (somename).path.xml but it's too tedious? Well fear not young grasshopper, here is a simple program to help you succeed!

## How to use:
1. Place the path.obj in the same place as the exe.
2. Open the exe and follow the instructions.
3. output.path.xml has been created!
(If it doesn't generate the file, try running the exe as administrator)
For Linux and Mac OS, open the terminal and go to where you have placed your files with Luxor2Sparkle.out and run it using the command ./Luxor2Sparkle_-_Linux/Mac.out    

## Credits
Thanks to MumboJumbo and 10tons for making Luxor and Sparkle respectively.

Special thanks to flarecultist for being the tester :)

I recommend using Konisbored's [N.O.D.E](http://spherematchers.proboards.com/thread/413/nocturnal-devertice-editor-luxor-creator?page=1) to make .obj paths
